# Elixir2D 

Elixir2D is an open source framework for HTML5 powered browser games.

## Why Elixir2D?
Elixir2D is aimed at simplifying the game creation process by providing common gameplay features at your disposal.
Games are structured and ran with 3 simple functions for the user to program, which are the setup, start, and end functions.
Each game configuration is housed within a single file to easily keep track of and manage. Elixir2D also allows for the implementation of multiple games per website, so you can have collections of levels within one single site.
